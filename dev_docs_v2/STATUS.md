   - Backend mapping: 43 modules, 150+ endpoints documented

2. ✅ **16-Week MVP Plan** (Feb 8)
   - 72 tasks across 6 phases (was 77, Load Board deferred)
   - 390-460h estimation
   - Milestone checkpoints + risk register

3. ✅ **Design System Iteration & Approval** (Feb 9-12)
   - 31 TMS components built in `apps/web/components/tms/`
   - 26 Storybook stories created
   - 7 design iterations tested
   - Rabih V1 approved by stakeholder (navy accent, Inter font, warm borders)
   - 3-layer token architecture designed

4. ✅ **Project Documentation Structure** (Feb 8)
   - `dev_docs_v2/` hierarchy created
   - STATUS.md task dashboard
   - 8 service hub files
   - Component catalog + task files

5. ✅ **Scope Refinement** (Feb 12)
   - Load Board deferred to post-MVP (saves ~30h, reduces from 8→7 services)
   - Focus on core TMS operations for MVP

### Sprint Health

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0 tasks | 10/10 | 10/10 | ✅ 100% |
| Phase 1 tasks | 8/8 | 8/8 | ✅ 100% |
| Design approval | Week 2 | Week 2 | ✅ On time |
| Extra deliverables | 0 | 5 major | ✅ +500% value |
| Sprint blocked days | 0 | 3 days | ⚠️ Design approval delay |

**Net Assessment:** 100% sprint delivery (18/18 tasks planned) + 5 major strategic deliverables = **exceptional 2-week output**. Phase 1 completed same day as unblock. Ready for Phase 2.

## Task Claiming Protocol (2 Developers)

> Both developers work independently with different AI tools. Coordinate via git.

1. **`git pull`** before claiming any task
2. Find a task with Assigned = "—" in the current phase below
3. Write your name in the "Assigned" column, change status to `IN PROGRESS`
4. **Commit and push immediately:** `git add dev_docs_v2/STATUS.md && git commit -m "task: claim TASK-ID" && git push`
5. If a task is already assigned — pick a different one
6. If blocked — change status to `BLOCKED`, add a note in the task file
7. When done — mark `DONE`, add today's date in "Updated" column

**Tip:** Work on different phases simultaneously to avoid file conflicts (e.g., one dev on Phase 0 bugs, the other on Phase 1 components).

## How to Use This File

1. **Before starting work:** Find an unassigned task, write your name in "Assigned", change status to "IN PROGRESS"
2. **After completing work:** Change status to "DONE", update the "Updated" column with today's date
3. **If blocked:** Change status to "BLOCKED", add a note about what's blocking you
4. **Dependencies:** Check the task file — some tasks are blocked by others

**Status values:** `NOT STARTED` | `IN PROGRESS` | `DONE` | `BLOCKED` | `RESERVED`
