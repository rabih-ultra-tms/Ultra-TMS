## Project Summary

### The Problem

Freight brokerages and 3PLs are stuck with:

- Legacy TMS systems with 20-year-old UIs
- Fragmented tools (TMS + CRM + Accounting + Portals)
- Painful migrations that lock them in
- Rigid workflows that don't match their operations
- No mobile-first experience for drivers

### Our Solution

A unified, modern logistics platform that:

- Replaces 5-7 separate tools with one integrated system
- Makes migration from legacy systems painless
- Adapts to your workflow, not the other way around
- Provides mobile-first experience for all users
- Supports multiple logistics verticals from day one

### Why Now

- Post-COVID digitization demand in logistics
- Legacy TMS vendors (McLeod, TMW) have stagnant UIs
- New entrants (Rose Rocket, Convoy) proving market appetite
- Your existing HubSpot + manual processes = proof of concept
