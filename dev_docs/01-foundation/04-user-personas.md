## Using Personas in Development

### When Building Features

1. Ask: "Which persona benefits most?"
2. Design for that persona's workflow
3. Validate with other personas for conflicts
4. Test with real users matching persona

I want to see all my loads on a map,
So that I don't have to make check calls.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Map shows all active loads
- Updates every 5 minutes
- Click to see load details
- Filter by status
```

### When Prioritizing

- Features serving multiple personas = higher priority
- Carlos (Spanish driver) must not be afterthought
- Mike (customer) enables revenue growth
- Emily (AR) enables cash flow
