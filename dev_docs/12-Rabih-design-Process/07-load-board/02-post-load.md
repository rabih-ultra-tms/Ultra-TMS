## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Create load posting form for publishing loads to the internal board. Includes origin/destination, equipment requirements, rate, pickup/delivery dates, and special instructions.

## Key Design Considerations
- Auto-fill from existing load data to minimize duplicate entry
- Rate guidance based on lane history and market data would improve posting accuracy

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data for auto-fill)
- Service 26 - Rate Intelligence (market rate data)
