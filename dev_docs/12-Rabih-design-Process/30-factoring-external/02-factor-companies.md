## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List view of all registered factoring companies showing company name, contact info, advance rates, fee structures, active status, and total factored volume.

## Key Design Considerations
- Side-by-side comparison capability to evaluate factor companies on rates, fees, and reliability
- Quick-access actions for viewing details, editing terms, or deactivating a factor relationship

## Dependencies
- Factor Setup (Service 30, Screen 3) for creating new factor companies
- Invoice and payment data for factored volume calculations
- Contract terms and fee schedule data
