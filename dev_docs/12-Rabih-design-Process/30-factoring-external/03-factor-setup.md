## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Configuration form for adding and editing factoring company profiles, including company details, advance rates, fee structures, reserve requirements, and integration credentials.

## Key Design Considerations
- Multi-section form covering company info, financial terms, and API integration settings
- Fee schedule builder supporting tiered rates based on invoice age or volume brackets

## Dependencies
- Factor Companies list (Service 30, Screen 2)
- Integration Hub for API credential management
- Document service for storing factoring agreements
