List

## Description
Tracking interface for monitoring payments received from factoring companies, including advance payments, reserve releases, fee deductions, and payment reconciliation status.

## Key Design Considerations
- Payment reconciliation workflow matching factor remittances against submitted invoices
- Discrepancy highlighting for amounts that do not match expected advance rates or fee calculations

## Dependencies
- Purchase Requests (Service 30, Screen 4)
- Accounting service for payment posting
- Bank feed integration for payment verification
