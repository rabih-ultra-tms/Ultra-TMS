## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Agent creation form for onboarding new agents/brokers. Includes personal information, contact details, commission plan selection, territory assignment, user account creation, and agreement upload.

## Key Design Considerations
- Commission plan selection with plan preview helps ensure correct assignment
- Agent agreement upload and e-signature integration formalizes the relationship

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (user account creation)
- Service 08 - Commission (commission plan selection)
- Service 10 - Documents (agreement upload and e-signature)
