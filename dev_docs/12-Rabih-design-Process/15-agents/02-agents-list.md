## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
All agents/brokers list showing agent name, status (active, inactive, pending), territory, total revenue, load count, commission plan, and hire date. Supports filtering by status, territory, and performance tier.

## Key Design Considerations
- Performance indicators inline with agent data enable quick assessment without opening detail view
- Bulk actions for status changes and commission plan assignments

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (admin permissions)
