## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Full agent profile showing personal information, commission plan, territory assignments, customer portfolio, revenue history, load activity, and commission statements.

## Key Design Considerations
- Tabbed layout separating profile, performance, customers, and commissions keeps complex data organized
- Customer portfolio view shows which customers the agent manages and their activity

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (agent's customer portfolio)
- Service 08 - Commission (agent's commission data)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (agent's load history)
