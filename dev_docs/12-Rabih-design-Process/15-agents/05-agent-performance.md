## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Agent performance metrics report showing revenue generated, load count, average margin, customer acquisition, customer retention, and performance trends over time. Supports comparison between agents.

## Key Design Considerations
- Agent-to-agent comparison enables performance benchmarking and coaching opportunities
- Goal tracking with progress indicators motivates agents and identifies underperformers early

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load and revenue data by agent)
- Service 02 - CRM (customer acquisition data)
- Service 18 - Analytics (shared reporting infrastructure)
