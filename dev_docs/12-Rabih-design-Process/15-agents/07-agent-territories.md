## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Config

## Description
Territory assignment configuration showing geographic territories (states, regions, zip code ranges) assigned to each agent. Supports visual map-based territory definition and overlap detection.

## Key Design Considerations
- Visual map-based territory assignment is more intuitive than text-based state/zip entry
- Overlap detection and conflict resolution prevent multiple agents claiming the same territory

## Dependencies
- Agent profiles within this service
- Mapping service for territory visualization
