## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Viewer

## Description
Document viewing screen supporting PDF, image (JPG, PNG), and common document formats. Includes zoom, rotation, page navigation, download, print, and annotation capabilities.

## Key Design Considerations
- Must handle large PDFs (multi-page BOLs) with smooth rendering and page navigation
- Inline viewing without requiring download improves workflow speed for operations staff

## Dependencies
- Document library within this service
- PDF rendering library (pdf.js or equivalent)
