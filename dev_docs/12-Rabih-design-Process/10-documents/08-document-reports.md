## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Document analytics report showing upload volumes, document types distribution, storage utilization, missing document tracking (loads without PODs), and user activity metrics.

## Key Design Considerations
- Missing document tracking (e.g., delivered loads without POD upload) is critical for billing workflow
- Storage utilization trends help plan infrastructure capacity

## Dependencies
- All document data within this service
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data for missing document identification)
