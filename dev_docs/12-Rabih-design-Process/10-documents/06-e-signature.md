## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Electronic signature tool for signing documents within the TMS. Supports signature capture (draw, type, upload), signature placement on documents, multi-party signing workflows, and signed document storage.

## Key Design Considerations
- Legal compliance (ESIGN Act, UETA) requires proper audit trail and tamper-evident sealing
- Multi-party signing workflow (e.g., rate confirmation requiring both broker and carrier signatures) needs clear status tracking

## Dependencies
- Document viewer within this service (for document display during signing)
- Service 11 - Communication (email notifications for signature requests)
