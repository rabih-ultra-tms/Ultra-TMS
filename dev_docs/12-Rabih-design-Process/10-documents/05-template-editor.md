## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Template creation and editing form with a visual editor for designing document templates. Supports merge field insertion (customer name, load number, etc.), layout configuration, logo placement, and template preview.

## Key Design Considerations
- Merge field system must map to available data fields across all services (loads, carriers, customers)
- WYSIWYG editor with PDF preview ensures templates look correct before deployment

## Dependencies
- Template manager within this service
- Data field catalog from across all services for merge fields
