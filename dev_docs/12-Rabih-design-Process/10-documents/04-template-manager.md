## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Document template library listing all available templates (rate confirmations, BOLs, invoices, contracts, letters) with template name, type, last modified date, and usage count.

## Key Design Considerations
- Template versioning is important to maintain document consistency and audit trail
- Preview capability without opening the full editor speeds up template selection

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (admin permissions for template management)
