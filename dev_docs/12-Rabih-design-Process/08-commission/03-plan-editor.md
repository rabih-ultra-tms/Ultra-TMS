## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Commission plan creation and editing form. Supports configuring commission type (percentage of margin, percentage of revenue, flat per load), tiered structures, bonus thresholds, and effective date ranges.

## Key Design Considerations
- Tiered commission structures with multiple breakpoints need an intuitive visual editor
- Plan simulation (preview calculated commissions against historical data) would validate plan design

## Dependencies
- Service 15 - Agents (agent assignment)
- Commission plans list within this service
