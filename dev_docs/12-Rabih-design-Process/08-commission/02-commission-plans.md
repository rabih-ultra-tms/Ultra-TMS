## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of all commission plan configurations showing plan name, type (percentage, flat, tiered), assigned agents, effective dates, and status (active/inactive).

## Key Design Considerations
- Plan comparison view would help admins evaluate different commission structures
- Must show which agents are assigned to each plan and handle plan transitions gracefully

## Dependencies
- Service 15 - Agents (agent assignments to plans)
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (admin permissions)
