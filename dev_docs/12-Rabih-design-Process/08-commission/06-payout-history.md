## Screen Type
List

## Description
Payment history list showing all commission payouts made to agents, including payment date, amount, method, period covered, and payment status. Supports filtering by agent, date range, and status.

## Key Design Considerations
- Year-to-date totals and tax-related summaries are important for agent financial planning
- Must reconcile with accounting service payment records for audit purposes

## Dependencies
- Service 06 - Accounting (payment processing and records)
- Commission statements within this service
