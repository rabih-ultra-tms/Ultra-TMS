## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Earnings overview dashboard showing total commissions earned, pending payouts, commission trends over time, and top-earning agents. Provides quick access to statements and payout history.

## Key Design Considerations
- Sales agents need a self-service view of their own earnings; admins need a team-wide view
- Real-time commission accrual as loads are completed would increase sales motivation

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (completed load data)
- Service 06 - Accounting (revenue data)
- Service 15 - Agents (agent profiles)
