## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Active workflows dashboard showing running workflow instance count, pending approvals, workflow completion rates, average processing times, bottleneck identification, and workflow health metrics.

## Key Design Considerations
- Bottleneck identification (steps where workflows stall) is critical for process improvement
- Pending approval count with aging ensures approvals are not lost or forgotten

## Dependencies
- Workflow instances data within this service
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (user data for approver assignment)
