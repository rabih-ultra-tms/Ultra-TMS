## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Workflow definitions list showing all workflow templates with name, trigger type, number of steps, active instances count, last modified date, and status (active, draft, disabled).

## Key Design Considerations
- Template versioning ensures running workflows complete with their original definition
- Usage statistics help identify which workflows are most valuable and which are unused

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (admin permissions)
