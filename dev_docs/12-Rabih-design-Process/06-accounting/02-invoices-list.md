## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Customer invoices list displaying all invoices with filtering by status (draft, sent, paid, overdue, void), customer, date range, and amount.

## Key Design Considerations
- Must support bulk actions (send, void, export) for efficient invoice management
- Aging indicators and overdue highlighting are critical for collections workflow

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data linked to invoices)
