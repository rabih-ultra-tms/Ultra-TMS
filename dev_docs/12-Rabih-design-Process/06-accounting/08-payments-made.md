## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of all payments made to carriers, showing payment date, amount, carrier, payment method, and associated bills. Tracks ACH, check, and wire payments.

## Key Design Considerations
- Must track payment method and provide audit trail for each disbursement
- Quick-pay vs standard payment term tracking needs clear visual distinction

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier banking info)
- Carrier payables records within this service
