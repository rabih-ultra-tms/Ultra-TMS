## Design Status

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Accounts receivable aging report showing outstanding customer balances organized by aging buckets (Current, 1-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days). Supports customer-level drill-down and collection prioritization.

## Key Design Considerations
- Aging bucket visualization must make collection priorities immediately obvious
- Customer drill-down to individual overdue invoices is critical for collections workflow

## Dependencies
- Invoice and payment records within this service
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data)
- Service 16 - Credit (credit limit and collection data)
