## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Account setup and management screen for the chart of accounts. Displays account hierarchy (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) with account numbers, names, types, and balances.

## Key Design Considerations
- Hierarchical account structure must be easy to navigate and manage
- Account deactivation must prevent future posting while preserving historical data

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (admin role required for account management)
