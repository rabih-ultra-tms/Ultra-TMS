## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
General ledger transaction list showing all journal entries with debit/credit details, account assignments, dates, and references. Supports filtering by account, date range, and transaction type.

## Key Design Considerations
- Double-entry accounting format must be clear and auditable
- Must support drill-down from GL entry to source transaction (invoice, payment, etc.)

## Dependencies
- Chart of accounts within this service
- All transaction records (invoices, payments, bills) within this service
