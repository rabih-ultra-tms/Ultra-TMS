## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Form for entering carrier bills into the system. Supports linking bills to loads, rate confirmation matching, and accessorial charge entry.

## Key Design Considerations
- Rate confirmation comparison is critical to catch billing discrepancies before payment
- Must support multiple charge types including detention, TONU, and accessorials

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier info)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load and rate confirmation data)
