## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
All customer credit limits list showing customer name, credit limit, current balance, available credit, utilization percentage, credit status (active, hold, suspended), and last review date.

## Key Design Considerations
- Utilization percentage with color coding (green/yellow/red) enables quick risk scanning
- Inline credit limit adjustment with approval workflow for limit changes

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data)
- Service 06 - Accounting (current AR balance per customer)
