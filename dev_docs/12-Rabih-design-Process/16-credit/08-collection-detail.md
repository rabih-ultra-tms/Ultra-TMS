## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Detailed collection activity view for a specific customer showing overdue invoices, payment promises, collection contact history, escalation status, and resolution actions (payment plan, write-off, legal).

## Key Design Considerations
- Complete contact history timeline ensures any team member can pick up collection efforts without context loss
- Escalation workflow (friendly reminder > formal demand > payment plan > legal) must be structured and trackable

## Dependencies
- Collection queue data within this service
- Service 06 - Accounting (invoice details for the customer)
- Service 11 - Communication (collection correspondence)
