## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Credit application submission form for requesting credit for a new or existing customer. Includes company information, requested credit amount, trade references, bank references, and financial statements upload.

## Key Design Considerations
- Auto-fill from CRM customer data minimizes duplicate entry for existing customers
- Trade reference collection with automated verification request (email) speeds up the review process

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data for auto-fill)
- Service 11 - Communication (trade reference verification emails)
- Service 10 - Documents (financial statement uploads)
