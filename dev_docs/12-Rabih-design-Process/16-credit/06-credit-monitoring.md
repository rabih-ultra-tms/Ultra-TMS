## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Credit watch list dashboard monitoring customers with elevated credit risk. Shows customers approaching credit limits, deteriorating payment patterns, D&B score changes, and customers on credit hold.

## Key Design Considerations
- Early warning indicators (slowing payment velocity, increasing disputes) predict credit problems before they become losses
- Automated alerts when customers cross utilization thresholds enable proactive intervention

## Dependencies
- Credit limits data within this service
- Service 06 - Accounting (payment pattern analysis)
- DNB integration for ongoing credit monitoring
