## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Credit overview dashboard showing total credit exposure, customers on credit hold, pending credit applications, collection queue size, bad debt write-offs, and credit utilization trends.

## Key Design Considerations
- Total credit exposure vs total credit limits provides immediate risk assessment
- Credit hold alerts must be prominent to prevent dispatching loads to over-limit customers

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data)
- Service 06 - Accounting (AR data for exposure calculation)
