## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Carrier's active and completed loads list showing load number, origin, destination, status, pickup/delivery dates, rate, and document status (BOL uploaded, POD uploaded). Supports filtering by status and date.

## Key Design Considerations
- Document upload status indicators (missing BOL, missing POD) drive document submission compliance
- Clear distinction between active/in-transit loads and completed/historical loads

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (carrier's assigned loads)
- Service 10 - Documents (document upload status)
