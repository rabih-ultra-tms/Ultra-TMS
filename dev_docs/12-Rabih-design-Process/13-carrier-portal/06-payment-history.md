## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Carrier payment records showing all payments received from the brokerage with payment date, amount, associated loads, payment method, and status. Supports filtering by date range and downloading payment remittance.

## Key Design Considerations
- Payment remittance detail download (PDF) is essential for carrier accounting reconciliation
- Quick Pay vs standard payment tracking with expected payment date visibility

## Dependencies
- Service 06 - Accounting (payment data for this carrier)
