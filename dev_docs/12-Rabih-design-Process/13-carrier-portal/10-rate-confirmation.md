## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Rate confirmation view and signing screen showing load details, agreed rate, terms and conditions, and e-signature capture. Carrier can review, sign, and download the rate confirmation document.

## Key Design Considerations
- E-signature must be legally binding with proper audit trail and timestamp
- Rate confirmation must clearly show all charges, accessorials, and payment terms before signing

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load and rate data)
- Service 10 - Documents (rate confirmation PDF generation and e-signature)
