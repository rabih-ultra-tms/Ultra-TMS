## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Equipment management list for carriers to manage their fleet -- trucks, trailers, and equipment. Shows equipment type, ID/number, status (available, in-use, maintenance), and specifications.

## Key Design Considerations
- Equipment availability status helps dispatchers and load matching algorithms
- Simple add/edit/remove workflow keeps equipment list current with minimal carrier effort

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (equipment records)
