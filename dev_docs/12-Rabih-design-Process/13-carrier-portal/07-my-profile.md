## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Carrier profile management form for updating company information, contact details, service area, equipment types, payment preferences, and preferred lanes. Changes may require brokerage review/approval.

## Key Design Considerations
- Sensitive changes (banking info, payment terms) should require additional verification and brokerage approval
- Profile completeness indicator encourages carriers to fill in all optional fields

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier profile data)
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (profile update approval workflow)
