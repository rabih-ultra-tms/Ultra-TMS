## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Carrier support chat interface for real-time communication with dispatch and support staff. Supports text messaging, photo sharing (for delivery issues), load-context chat, and bilingual support (English/Spanish).

## Key Design Considerations
- Bilingual support (English/Spanish) is critical for the carrier demographic
- Load-context chat (chat associated with specific load) keeps conversations organized and actionable

## Dependencies
- Service 11 - Communication (message routing to dispatch/support)
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time chat
- Service 27 - Help Desk (ticket creation from chat if needed)
