## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Carrier-facing dashboard showing load offers overview, active loads count, pending documents, upcoming payments, and compliance status alerts. Provides quick actions for common carrier tasks.

## Key Design Considerations
- New load offers must be prominently featured with accept/decline actions for fast response
- Compliance alerts (expiring insurance) must be unmissable to prevent carrier suspension

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load offers, active loads)
- Service 05 - Carrier (compliance status)
- Service 06 - Accounting (pending payment data)
