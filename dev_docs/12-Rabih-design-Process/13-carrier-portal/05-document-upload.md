## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Document upload form for carriers to submit BOLs, PODs, and other load-related documents. Supports camera capture (mobile), file upload, document type selection, and load association.

## Key Design Considerations
- Mobile-optimized camera capture is essential as most carrier uploads happen from phones at delivery
- Auto-association with the correct load based on context reduces upload errors

## Dependencies
- Service 10 - Documents (document storage)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load association)
