## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of available loads for the carrier to bid on or accept. Shows origin, destination, pickup date, equipment type, rate, and distance. Supports filtering by lane, date, and equipment type.

## Key Design Considerations
- Load list must load quickly and update in real-time as loads are claimed by other carriers
- One-click accept/bid workflow minimizes friction for carrier engagement

## Dependencies
- Service 07 - Load Board (posted loads data)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load details)
