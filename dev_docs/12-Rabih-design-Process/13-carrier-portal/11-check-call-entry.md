## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Check call submission form for carriers to report their current status and location. Supports location sharing (GPS), status updates (loaded, in transit, at delivery, empty), ETA updates, and notes.

## Key Design Considerations
- One-tap location sharing via mobile GPS minimizes friction for busy drivers
- Pre-set status options with optional notes balance speed and detail

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load tracking updates)
- Device GPS for location capture
