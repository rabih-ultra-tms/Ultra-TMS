## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Insurance certificate upload form for carriers to submit updated insurance documents. Shows current insurance status, expiration dates, minimum coverage requirements, and upload form with certificate type selection.

## Key Design Considerations
- Clear display of minimum coverage requirements prevents invalid certificate submissions
- Expiration countdown with urgency alerts motivates timely insurance renewal

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (current insurance records and requirements)
- Service 10 - Documents (certificate storage)
