## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Detailed load offer view showing complete load information -- origin/destination with map, pickup/delivery windows, commodity, weight, equipment requirements, special instructions, rate, and accept/decline buttons.

## Key Design Considerations
- Map view with route visualization helps carriers evaluate the load's fit with their current position
- All critical information (rate, dates, requirements) must be visible without scrolling

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load details)
- Mapping service (Google Maps or Mapbox)
