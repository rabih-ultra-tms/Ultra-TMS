## Description
Check rates by lane tool allowing users to enter origin/destination and get current market rates, historical averages, and internal rate history for that specific lane.

## Key Design Considerations
- Auto-complete for city/zip/state with map visualization of the lane
- Instant results with breakdown by data source, equipment type, and confidence level

## Dependencies
- External rate data providers
- Internal rate history from loads
- Location/geocoding service for origin/destination lookup
