## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Payroll summary dashboard showing current pay period status, total payroll amounts, pending approvals, deduction summaries, and integration status with external payroll providers.

## Key Design Considerations
- Pay period timeline with milestone tracking (timesheet cutoff, approval deadline, processing date, pay date)
- Exception dashboard highlighting employees with missing timesheets, unapproved hours, or payroll discrepancies

## Dependencies
- Time & Attendance (Service 33, Screen 5) for hours data
- Accounting service for payroll posting
- External payroll provider integration via Integration Hub
