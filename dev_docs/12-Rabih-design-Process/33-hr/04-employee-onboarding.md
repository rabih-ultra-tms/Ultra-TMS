## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form/Wizard

## Description
Step-by-step onboarding wizard for new employees covering personal information collection, document uploads, benefits enrollment, equipment assignment, training scheduling, and system access provisioning.

## Key Design Considerations
- Role-specific onboarding workflows with different steps for drivers vs. office staff vs. management
- Onboarding progress tracker showing completion percentage and outstanding tasks for each new hire

## Dependencies
- Employees List (Service 33, Screen 2)
- Authentication service for creating user accounts
- Document service for collecting required documents
- Training (Service 33, Screen 9) for scheduling orientation
