## Screen Type
List

## Description
Time and attendance tracking interface showing clock-in/out records, hours worked, overtime calculations, schedule adherence, and timesheet approval workflows.

## Key Design Considerations
- Calendar and list view toggle for reviewing attendance patterns across different time periods
- Manager approval workflow with exception flagging for missed punches, overtime, and policy violations

## Dependencies
- Employee data (Service 33, Screen 2)
- Payroll Overview (Service 33, Screen 7) for hours feeding into payroll
- Leave Management (Service 33, Screen 6) for absence correlation
