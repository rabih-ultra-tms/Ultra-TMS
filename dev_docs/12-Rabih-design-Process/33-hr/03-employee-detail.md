## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Comprehensive employee profile displaying personal information, employment history, compensation details, benefits enrollment, training records, documents, and performance notes.

## Key Design Considerations
- Tabbed layout organizing employee data into logical sections (Personal, Employment, Compensation, Documents, Training)
- Sensitive data access controls ensuring compensation and personal details are restricted to authorized HR personnel

## Dependencies
- Employees List (Service 33, Screen 2) for navigation
- Document service for employee documents
- Training records (Service 33, Screen 9)
- Benefits data (Service 33, Screen 8)
