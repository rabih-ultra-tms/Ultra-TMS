## Screen Type
List

## Description
Searchable and filterable list of all employees showing name, department, role, hire date, status, and contact information with bulk action capabilities.

## Key Design Considerations
- Advanced filtering by department, role, status, hire date range, and location
- Bulk actions for common HR tasks like status changes, department transfers, and communication

## Dependencies
- Authentication service for employee user data
- Employee Detail (Service 33, Screen 3) for drill-down
- Employee Onboarding (Service 33, Screen 4) for new hire creation
