## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form/Wizard

## Description
Step-by-step configuration wizard for setting up a new integration, including authentication, endpoint configuration, data mapping, sync frequency, and connection testing.

## Key Design Considerations
- Multi-step wizard with progress tracking and the ability to save partial configurations
- Built-in connection test and validation at each step before proceeding

## Dependencies
- Available Integrations catalog (Service 20, Screen 2)
- API Key Management (Service 20, Screen 4)
- Data Mapping configuration (Service 20, Screen 6)
