## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Field mapping configuration interface for defining how data fields translate between the TMS platform and external systems, including transformation rules and default values.

## Key Design Considerations
- Visual drag-and-drop mapping interface connecting source fields to destination fields
- Support for data transformation rules, conditional mappings, and custom field converters

## Dependencies
- Integration Setup (Service 20, Screen 3)
- Schema definitions from connected external services
- Internal data model field definitions
