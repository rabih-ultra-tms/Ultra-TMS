## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Complex query builder that allows users to construct multi-criteria searches with AND/OR logic, date ranges, numeric comparisons, and entity-specific filters.

## Key Design Considerations
- Query builder UI must be intuitive for non-technical users while supporting complex logic
- Should allow combining multiple entity types and cross-referencing relationships

## Dependencies
- Global Search for basic search infrastructure
- All entity services for available filter fields and data types
