## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Config

## Description
Search configuration screen for administrators to manage search indexing, result ranking, searchable fields, and search behavior across the platform.

## Key Design Considerations
- Must allow admins to control which fields are indexed and how they are weighted
- Configuration changes may require re-indexing, so clear feedback on processing status is needed

## Dependencies
- Search indexing infrastructure
- Config service for storing search settings
