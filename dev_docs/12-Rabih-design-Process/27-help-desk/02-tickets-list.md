## Screen Type
List

## Description
All support tickets with filtering by status (open, in progress, resolved, closed), priority, category, assigned agent, and date range.

## Key Design Considerations
- Priority-based sorting with visual urgency indicators and SLA countdown timers
- Quick assignment and status change actions directly from the list view

## Dependencies
- New Ticket form for ticket creation
- Support agent roster for assignment
- Notification service for status change alerts
