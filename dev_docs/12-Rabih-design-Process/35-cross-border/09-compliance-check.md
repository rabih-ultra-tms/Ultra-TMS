## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Pre-border compliance verification tool that checks a load's readiness for border crossing by validating documentation completeness, carrier credentials, commodity restrictions, and regulatory requirements.

## Key Design Considerations
- Automated checklist validation with pass/fail indicators and remediation guidance for each requirement
- Restricted party screening integration to check shippers, consignees, and carriers against government watch lists

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for load and shipment data
- Document Requirements (Service 35, Screen 6) for document checklist
- Carrier service for carrier border crossing credentials
- Government restricted party list databases
