## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Cross-border operations overview showing active border crossings, pending customs entries, compliance status, broker activity, bond utilization, and border delay metrics.

## Key Design Considerations
- Real-time border crossing status tracker with estimated wait times at key ports of entry
- Compliance readiness indicators for loads approaching the border with missing or incomplete documentation

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for loads with cross-border routes
- Customs entry data (Service 35, Screen 2)
- Broker Management data (Service 35, Screen 5)
