## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Tariff classification search tool for looking up HTS (Harmonized Tariff Schedule) codes, duty rates, trade agreement eligibility, and special program indicators for commodities crossing borders.

## Key Design Considerations
- Hierarchical browse and keyword search for navigating the HTS classification tree
- Duty rate calculator showing applicable rates based on country of origin, trade agreements, and special programs

## Dependencies
- HTS tariff database (updated regularly)
- Trade agreement reference data (USMCA, etc.)
- New Entry (Service 35, Screen 4) for inline classification during entry creation
