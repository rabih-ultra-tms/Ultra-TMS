List

## Description
Management interface for customs broker relationships showing broker company details, license information, port coverage, performance metrics, fee schedules, and active entry assignments.

## Key Design Considerations
- Broker performance scorecards comparing clearance times, accuracy rates, and fee competitiveness
- Port-of-entry coverage mapping showing which brokers service specific border crossings

## Dependencies
- Customs Entries (Service 35, Screen 2) for broker assignment data
- Document service for broker license and agreement documents
- Integration Hub for broker communication APIs
