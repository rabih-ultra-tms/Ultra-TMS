## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of all customs entries showing entry number, load reference, entry type, port of entry, status, broker, duty amounts, and processing timeline.

## Key Design Considerations
- Status pipeline visualization showing entry progression from preparation through clearance
- Quick filters for entry status, port of entry, broker, and date range for efficient entry management

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for associated load data
- Broker Management (Service 35, Screen 5) for broker assignments
- Entry Detail (Service 35, Screen 3) for drill-down
