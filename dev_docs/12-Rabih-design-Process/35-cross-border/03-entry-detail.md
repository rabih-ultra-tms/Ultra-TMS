## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Detailed view of a single customs entry showing complete entry information, line items, tariff classifications, duty calculations, document checklist, processing history, and government response data.

## Key Design Considerations
- Document checklist with status indicators showing which required documents are attached vs. missing
- Duty and fee calculation breakdown with tariff classification details for each line item

## Dependencies
- Customs Entries (Service 35, Screen 2) for navigation
- Document service for attached customs documents
- Tariff Lookup (Service 35, Screen 7) for classification data
