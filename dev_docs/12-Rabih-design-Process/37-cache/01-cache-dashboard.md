## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Cache performance overview showing hit/miss ratios, memory utilization, eviction rates, top cached keys, latency metrics, and cache health indicators across all cache backends.

## Key Design Considerations
- Real-time cache performance gauges with hit ratio trending and memory pressure indicators
- Per-service cache utilization breakdown showing which services consume the most cache resources

## Dependencies
- Cache backend infrastructure (Redis, Memcached)
- Performance monitoring data
- Cache Management data (Service 37, Screen 2)
