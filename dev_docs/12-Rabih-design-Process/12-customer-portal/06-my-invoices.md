## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Customer's invoices list showing all invoices with invoice number, date, amount, due date, payment status, and remaining balance. Supports invoice PDF download and online payment initiation.

## Key Design Considerations
- Payment status must be instantly clear (paid, partially paid, overdue) with color coding
- Online payment integration would reduce payment collection time significantly

## Dependencies
- Service 06 - Accounting (invoice data filtered by customer)
- Service 10 - Documents (invoice PDF generation)
