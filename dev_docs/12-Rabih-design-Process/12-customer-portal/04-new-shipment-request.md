## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Shipment request and quote form for customers to submit new shipment requests. Includes origin/destination, pickup/delivery dates, commodity details, equipment type, special requirements, and reference numbers.

## Key Design Considerations
- Form must be simple enough for customers unfamiliar with freight terminology
- Address autocomplete and saved locations reduce friction for repeat shippers

## Dependencies
- Service 03 - Sales (quote creation from request)
- Service 02 - CRM (customer saved locations and preferences)
