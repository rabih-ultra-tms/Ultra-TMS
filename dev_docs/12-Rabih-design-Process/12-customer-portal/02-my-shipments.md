## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Customer's loads list showing all shipments associated with the customer account. Displays load number, origin, destination, status, pickup/delivery dates, and tracking link. Supports filtering by status and date range.

## Key Design Considerations
- Status information must be customer-friendly (not internal jargon) with clear visual indicators
- Quick access to tracking and POD download for delivered shipments

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data filtered by customer)
