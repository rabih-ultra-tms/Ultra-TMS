## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Customer preferences and settings form for managing notification preferences (email alerts for shipment updates, invoice delivery), user profile, password change, saved locations, and default shipment settings.

## Key Design Considerations
- Notification preference granularity (per-event opt-in/out) prevents notification fatigue
- Saved locations and default settings reduce friction for repeat shipment requests

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (user profile management)
- Service 11 - Communication (notification preference settings)
