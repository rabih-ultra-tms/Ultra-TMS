## Design Status

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Customer-facing shipment overview dashboard showing active shipments count, recent shipment status, pending quotes, outstanding invoices, and quick action buttons for common tasks.

## Key Design Considerations
- Must be significantly simpler than internal dashboards -- customers need quick answers, not detailed analytics
- Branded experience with customer's company context and personalized greeting

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (active shipment data)
- Service 03 - Sales (pending quote data)
- Service 06 - Accounting (outstanding invoice data)
