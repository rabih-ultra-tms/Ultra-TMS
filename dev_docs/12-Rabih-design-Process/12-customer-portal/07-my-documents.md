## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Customer's document library showing all documents associated with their account -- BOLs, PODs, rate confirmations, invoices, contracts. Supports filtering by document type, date, and associated shipment.

## Key Design Considerations
- Document type categorization and shipment association make it easy to find specific documents
- Bulk download capability for accounting/audit purposes

## Dependencies
- Service 10 - Documents (document storage and retrieval)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (shipment association for documents)
