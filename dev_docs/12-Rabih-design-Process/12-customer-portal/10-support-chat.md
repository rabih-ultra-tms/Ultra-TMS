## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Customer support chat interface for real-time communication with brokerage support staff. Supports text messaging, file sharing, chat history, and automated responses for common questions.

## Key Design Considerations
- Chat must persist context across sessions so customers do not repeat information
- Integration with internal communication hub ensures support staff see all customer interactions in one place

## Dependencies
- Service 11 - Communication (message routing to support staff)
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time chat
- Service 27 - Help Desk (ticket creation from chat if needed)
