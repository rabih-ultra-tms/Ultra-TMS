## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Load tracking detail view showing shipment timeline, current location on map, status history, pickup/delivery confirmations, associated documents (BOL, POD), and invoice link.

## Key Design Considerations
- Real-time map tracking with estimated arrival time is the primary value proposition for customers
- Document access (BOL, POD) must be easy to find and download

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load details and tracking data)
- Service 10 - Documents (BOL, POD access)
- Mapping service (Google Maps or Mapbox)
