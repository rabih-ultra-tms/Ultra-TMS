## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Platform billing overview listing all tenant subscriptions, payment status, outstanding invoices, revenue summaries, and billing action items across the entire platform.

## Key Design Considerations
- Revenue dashboard with MRR/ARR tracking, churn metrics, and payment failure alerts
- Bulk billing actions for processing credits, adjusting plans, and managing payment retry schedules

## Dependencies
- Tenants List (Service 38, Screen 2) for tenant context
- Billing Detail (Service 38, Screen 12) for drill-down
- Payment processing provider integration
