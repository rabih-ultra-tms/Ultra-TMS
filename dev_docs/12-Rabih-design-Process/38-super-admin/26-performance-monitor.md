## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Application performance monitoring dashboard showing response times, throughput, resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk), service health, and performance bottleneck identification across the platform infrastructure.

## Key Design Considerations
- Service dependency map showing inter-service communication latency and failure rates
- Resource utilization trending with auto-scaling trigger visualization and capacity forecasting

## Dependencies
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) infrastructure
- Cloud provider APIs for infrastructure metrics
- API Analytics (Service 38, Screen 19) for endpoint-level performance
- Database Admin (Service 38, Screen 17) for database performance
