## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Detailed billing view for a specific tenant showing subscription plan, invoice history, payment methods, credits and adjustments, usage-based charges, and billing configuration.

## Key Design Considerations
- Complete invoice history with line-item detail, payment status, and downloadable PDF invoices
- Administrative controls for issuing credits, applying discounts, changing plans, and managing payment method issues

## Dependencies
- Billing Management (Service 38, Screen 11) for navigation
- Tenant Detail (Service 38, Screen 3) for tenant context
- Payment processing provider for payment method data
