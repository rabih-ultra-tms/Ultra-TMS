## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Tenant-specific configuration interface for managing plan limits, feature toggles, custom branding options, integration allowances, and operational parameters that override default platform settings.

## Key Design Considerations
- Override indicators showing which settings differ from platform defaults with easy reset-to-default capability
- Change impact preview showing how setting modifications will affect the tenant's available features and limits

## Dependencies
- Tenant Detail (Service 38, Screen 3) for context
- Feature Flags (Service 38, Screen 10) for feature-level controls
- Platform Settings (Service 38, Screen 9) for default values
