## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of all tenants on the platform showing company name, plan tier, user count, creation date, status (active, suspended, trial), and key usage metrics.

## Key Design Considerations
- Quick filters for tenant status, plan tier, and creation date with search across company names
- Inline actions for common operations like suspending, activating, or upgrading tenant accounts

## Dependencies
- Tenant Detail (Service 38, Screen 3) for drill-down
- Create Tenant (Service 38, Screen 4) for new tenant provisioning
- Billing Management (Service 38, Screen 11) for billing status
