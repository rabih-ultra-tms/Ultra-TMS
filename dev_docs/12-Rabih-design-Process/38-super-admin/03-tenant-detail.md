## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Comprehensive tenant profile showing company information, subscription details, user roster, feature flags, usage statistics, billing history, support tickets, and administrative action history.

## Key Design Considerations
- Tabbed layout organizing tenant data into sections (Overview, Users, Billing, Usage, Features, Support, Audit)
- Quick-action panel for common administrative operations like plan changes, feature toggles, and user management

## Dependencies
- Tenants List (Service 38, Screen 2) for navigation
- Tenant Settings (Service 38, Screen 5) for configuration
- Billing Detail (Service 38, Screen 12) for billing information
- Usage Metrics (Service 38, Screen 13) for tenant-specific usage data
