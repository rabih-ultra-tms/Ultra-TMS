## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Administrative form for overriding user-level settings, permissions, and restrictions, including role adjustments, feature access overrides, and account status changes with full audit logging.

## Key Design Considerations
- Clear visual distinction between tenant-level settings and platform-level overrides applied to the user
- Mandatory reason field and audit trail for all override actions to maintain accountability

## Dependencies
- User Directory (Service 38, Screen 6) for user selection
- Authentication service for permission management
- Audit service for logging all override actions
