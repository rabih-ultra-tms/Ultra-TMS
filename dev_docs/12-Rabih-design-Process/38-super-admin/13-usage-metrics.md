## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Platform usage analytics dashboard showing user activity, API call volumes, storage consumption, feature adoption rates, and resource utilization metrics across all tenants.

## Key Design Considerations
- Multi-tenant usage comparison with ability to drill down into individual tenant consumption patterns
- Threshold-based alerting for tenants approaching or exceeding plan limits with automated notification triggers

## Dependencies
- All platform services for usage data collection
- Billing Management (Service 38, Screen 11) for usage-based billing correlation
- Tenants List (Service 38, Screen 2) for tenant context
