## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
EDI field mapping editor for defining how EDI segments and elements map to system fields. Supports drag-and-drop mapping, transformation rules, default values, and conditional logic.

## Key Design Considerations
- Visual drag-and-drop mapping interface between EDI elements and system fields
- Must support complex transformation rules (concatenation, splitting, lookups, date formatting)

## Dependencies
- EDI schema definitions for standard transaction sets
- System entity field definitions
- Partner Setup for partner-specific mapping assignments
