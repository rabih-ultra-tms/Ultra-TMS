## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of all EDI trading partners with connection status, transaction volumes, last activity timestamps, and quick access to partner configuration.

## Key Design Considerations
- Connection status indicators (active, inactive, error) must be immediately visible
- Quick filtering by partner type (shipper, carrier, broker) and connection status

## Dependencies
- Customer and Carrier services for partner identity
- EDI connection infrastructure for status monitoring
