## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Detailed view of an individual change record showing the user, timestamp, entity affected, before/after values, IP address, and related context.

## Key Design Considerations
- Before/after diff view must clearly highlight what changed in a readable format
- Must link to the affected entity for quick navigation to the changed record

## Dependencies
- Audit Trail list for navigation
- Entity services for linking to original records
