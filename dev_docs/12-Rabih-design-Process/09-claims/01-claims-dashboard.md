## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Claim status overview dashboard showing open claims count, claims by status (filed, investigating, pending settlement, resolved), total claim value, average resolution time, and claims trend over time.

## Key Design Considerations
- Claims aging and urgency indicators are critical for prioritizing investigation efforts
- Financial exposure summary (total open claim value) is essential for management visibility

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data associated with claims)
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier information for claim context)
