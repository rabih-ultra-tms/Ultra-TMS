## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Full claim record showing claim type, associated load, claimant, carrier, claim amount, investigation notes, damage photos, timeline of events, settlement details, and resolution status.

## Key Design Considerations
- Claim timeline must show complete history from filing through resolution for audit purposes
- Tabbed layout separating claim info, investigation, photos, documents, and settlement keeps complex data organized

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (associated load details)
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier and insurance info)
- Service 10 - Documents (claim documents and photos)
