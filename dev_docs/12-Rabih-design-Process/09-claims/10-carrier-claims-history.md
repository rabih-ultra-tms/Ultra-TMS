## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Claims history filtered by carrier, showing all claims filed against a specific carrier with claim types, amounts, resolution status, and aggregate statistics (total claims count, total amount, claims rate per load).

## Key Design Considerations
- Claims rate per load is a key metric for carrier performance evaluation and future assignment decisions
- Must be accessible from the carrier detail screen for quick reference during dispatch decisions

## Dependencies
- Claims data within this service
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier profiles and load history for rate calculation)
