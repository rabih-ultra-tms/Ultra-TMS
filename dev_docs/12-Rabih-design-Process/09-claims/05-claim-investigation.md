## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Investigation notes form for documenting claim investigation progress. Supports structured investigation checklists, notes entries with timestamps, witness statements, and findings summary.

## Key Design Considerations
- Chronological investigation log must be append-only for audit integrity
- Investigation checklist templates for different claim types standardize the process

## Dependencies
- Claim record within this service
- Service 10 - Documents (investigation document uploads)
- Service 11 - Communication (correspondence with carrier/customer)
