## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Gallery

## Description
Claim photo evidence gallery for viewing, uploading, and annotating damage photos. Supports multiple image upload, zoom, annotation tools, before/after comparison, and photo metadata (date, location, photographer).

## Key Design Considerations
- Photo annotation tools (circles, arrows, text) are essential for highlighting damage areas
- Mobile-friendly upload is important as many photos are taken at delivery sites via phone

## Dependencies
- Claim record within this service
- Service 10 - Documents (image storage and retrieval)
