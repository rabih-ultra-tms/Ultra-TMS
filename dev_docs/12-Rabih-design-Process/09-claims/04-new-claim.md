## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
New claim filing form with fields for claim type, associated load (search/select), claimant (customer or carrier), claimed amount, description of damage/loss, incident date, and initial photo upload.

## Key Design Considerations
- Load lookup and auto-fill of carrier/customer/commodity data minimizes data entry
- Required field validation ensures complete claim records from the start

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load lookup and auto-fill)
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier data)
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data)
- Service 10 - Documents (photo upload)
