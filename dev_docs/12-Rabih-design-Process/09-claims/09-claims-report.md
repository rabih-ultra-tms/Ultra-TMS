## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Claims analysis report showing claim volume trends, average settlement amounts, resolution times, claims by type, claims by carrier, and financial impact. Supports date range selection and export.

## Key Design Considerations
- Trend analysis over time helps identify systemic issues (specific lanes, carriers, or commodities)
- Financial impact summary showing total claims cost vs revenue is critical for profitability analysis

## Dependencies
- All claims data within this service
- Service 18 - Analytics (shared reporting infrastructure)
