## Screen Type
List

## Description
Driver safety ratings list showing composite safety scores, individual category scores (HOS compliance, inspection results, incidents, violations), score trends, and ranking.

- Trend indicators showing improvement or decline over configurable time periods

## Dependencies
- Driver service for driver roster
- Incident data for accident/violation history
- ELD service for HOS compliance data
- Inspection records for inspection history
