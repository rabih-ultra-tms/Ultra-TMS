ELD compliance overview showing fleet-wide HOS status, active violations, device connectivity health, unidentified driving events requiring attention, and upcoming DVIR deadlines.

## Dependencies
- ELD device provider APIs via Integration Hub
- Driver/Carrier service for driver roster
- Safety service for compliance scoring
