## Description
Driver Vehicle Inspection Report management showing pre-trip and post-trip inspection records, defect reports, repair status, mechanic sign-offs, and compliance tracking.

## Key Design Considerations

- Compliance dashboard showing inspection completion rates and overdue inspections by vehicle and driver

## Dependencies
- ELD device data for electronic DVIR submissions
- Vehicle/asset data from Carrier service
- Document service for storing inspection report images
