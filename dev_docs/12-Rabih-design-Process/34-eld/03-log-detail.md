## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Detailed view of a single driver's daily log showing the graph grid (duty status timeline), event list, vehicle information, co-driver data, annotations, and edit history in FMCSA-compliant format.

## Key Design Considerations
- Standard FMCSA graph grid visualization with interactive duty status timeline and event markers
- Edit request workflow allowing drivers and managers to propose and approve log corrections with required annotations

## Dependencies
- Driver Logs (Service 34, Screen 2) for navigation
- ELD device data for event records
- Audit trail for log edit history
