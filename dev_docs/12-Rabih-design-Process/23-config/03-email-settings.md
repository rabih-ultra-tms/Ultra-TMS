## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Email configuration form for setting up SMTP servers, email templates, sender addresses, delivery rules, and email service provider integration.

## Key Design Considerations
- Must include a "test email" function to verify configuration before saving
- Template editor needs preview capability showing how emails will render

## Dependencies
- Email service provider (SendGrid, SES, etc.)
- Template storage
- Notification Config for email-triggered notifications
