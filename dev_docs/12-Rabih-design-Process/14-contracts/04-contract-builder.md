## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Contract creation and editing form with sections for customer selection, contract terms, rate table configuration (per lane, per equipment type), accessorial charges, payment terms, and document generation.

## Key Design Considerations
- Rate table builder with bulk import (CSV) capability handles large multi-lane contracts efficiently
- Template-based creation with customization reduces contract drafting time

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer selection)
- Contract templates within this service
- Service 10 - Documents (contract PDF generation)
- Service 26 - Rate Intelligence (market rate benchmarks for rate setting)
