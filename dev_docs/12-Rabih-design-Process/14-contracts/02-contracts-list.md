## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
All contracts list with filtering by status (active, expired, draft, pending), customer, contract type, effective date, and expiration date. Shows contract name, customer, value, dates, and status.

## Key Design Considerations
- Status-based color coding helps quickly identify contracts requiring attention
- Quick access to contract detail and renewal actions from the list view

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer names for display and filtering)
