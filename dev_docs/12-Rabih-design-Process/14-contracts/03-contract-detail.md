## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Full contract record showing contract terms, rate tables, lane-specific pricing, effective/expiration dates, associated customer, revision history, and linked documents.

## Key Design Considerations
- Rate table display with lane-specific pricing must be scannable and exportable
- Contract revision history with diff view shows what changed between versions

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer details)
- Service 10 - Documents (contract PDF, signed copies)
