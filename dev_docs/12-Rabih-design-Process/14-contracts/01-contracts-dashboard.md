## Description
Active contracts overview dashboard showing total active contracts, contract value, upcoming renewals, expiring contracts, and contract performance metrics (revenue under contract vs spot).

## Key Design Considerations

- Contract revenue vs spot revenue comparison demonstrates contract program value

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data for contract context)
- Service 06 - Accounting (revenue data for contract performance)
