## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Contract analytics report showing contract portfolio value, renewal rates, contract vs spot revenue split, rate trends by lane, and contract profitability analysis. Supports date range selection and export.

## Key Design Considerations
- Contract profitability analysis (contracted rate vs actual carrier cost) reveals margin performance
- Renewal rate tracking identifies customer retention trends

## Dependencies
- All contracts data within this service
- Service 06 - Accounting (revenue and cost data for profitability)
- Service 18 - Analytics (shared reporting infrastructure)
