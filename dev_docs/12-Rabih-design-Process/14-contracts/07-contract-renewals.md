## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Expiring contracts list showing contracts approaching expiration with days remaining, contract value, customer, renewal status (not started, in negotiation, renewed, lost), and assigned sales rep.

## Key Design Considerations
- Tiered urgency display (90/60/30 day warnings) drives proactive renewal engagement
- One-click renewal initiation creates new contract draft from existing terms

## Dependencies
- Contracts data within this service
- Service 02 - CRM (customer relationship context)
- Service 11 - Communication (renewal reminder notifications)
