## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
All fuel cards with filtering by status (active, suspended, cancelled), assigned driver, card provider, spending limits, and last transaction date.

## Key Design Considerations
- Quick card status management (activate, suspend, cancel) directly from the list
- Spending limit indicators showing utilization percentage for each card

## Dependencies
- Fuel card provider integration for card data
- Driver service for assignment information
- Card management APIs for status changes
