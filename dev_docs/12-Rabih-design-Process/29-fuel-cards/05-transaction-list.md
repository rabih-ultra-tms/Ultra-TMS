This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
All fuel transactions with filtering by card, driver, date range, amount, location, merchant, and transaction type (fuel, maintenance, other).

## Key Design Considerations
- Location-based filtering with map view for geographic transaction analysis
- Flagged transaction highlighting for items requiring review or investigation

## Dependencies
- Fuel card provider API for transaction data
- Driver and card services for association
- Fraud detection engine for flag status
