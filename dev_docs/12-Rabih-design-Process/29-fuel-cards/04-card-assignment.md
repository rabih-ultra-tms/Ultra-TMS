## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Assign fuel card to driver form including driver selection, card selection, spending limit configuration, authorized purchase types, and geographic restrictions.

## Key Design Considerations
- Driver lookup with current card assignment status to prevent duplicate assignments
- Configurable spending controls (daily/weekly/transaction limits, fuel-only restrictions)

## Dependencies
- Driver service for driver roster
- Fuel Cards List for available cards
- Card provider API for limit configuration
