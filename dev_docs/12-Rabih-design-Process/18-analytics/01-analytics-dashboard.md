## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Executive KPI overview dashboard showing top-level business metrics -- revenue, margin, load count, on-time delivery rate, carrier utilization, customer satisfaction, and trend comparisons (MTD, QTD, YTD).

## Key Design Considerations
- Executive audience requires clean, scannable layout with minimal clutter and maximum insight density
- Period comparison (vs prior month/quarter/year) provides context for all metrics

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load volume and delivery metrics)
- Service 06 - Accounting (revenue and margin data)
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier utilization metrics)
