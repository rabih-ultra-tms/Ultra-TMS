## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Revenue and cost analysis report showing revenue trends, gross margin by lane/customer/carrier, cost breakdown (carrier cost, overhead, commissions), profitability by segment, and cash flow analysis.

## Key Design Considerations
- Margin analysis by multiple dimensions (lane, customer, equipment type) reveals profitability drivers
- Revenue waterfall chart showing gross to net revenue with cost components provides clear P&L visibility

## Dependencies
- Service 06 - Accounting (revenue, cost, and payment data)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data for segmentation)
- Service 08 - Commission (commission cost data)
