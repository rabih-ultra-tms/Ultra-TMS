## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Customer insights report showing customer revenue ranking, shipment volume trends, margin by customer, customer lifetime value, retention rates, and customer segment analysis.

## Key Design Considerations
- Customer profitability ranking identifies which customers drive the most margin (not just revenue)
- Churn risk indicators based on declining shipment volume trigger proactive sales engagement

## Dependencies
- Service 02 - CRM (customer data and segmentation)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data by customer)
- Service 06 - Accounting (revenue and margin by customer)
