## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Lane performance report showing volume by lane, average rates, rate trends, margin by lane, transit time analysis, carrier availability, and seasonal patterns. Supports map visualization and lane comparison.

## Key Design Considerations
- Map-based lane visualization with volume/rate heat mapping provides intuitive geographic insight
- Seasonal pattern analysis helps predict capacity tightness and rate fluctuations

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data by lane)
- Service 06 - Accounting (rate and margin data by lane)
- Service 26 - Rate Intelligence (market rate benchmarks)
