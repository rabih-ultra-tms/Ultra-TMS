## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Carrier performance analytics showing carrier utilization rates, on-time performance trends, cost per mile by carrier, claims rates, acceptance rates, and carrier tier distribution changes over time.

## Key Design Considerations
- Carrier comparison matrix helps identify best-value carriers for specific lanes
- Trend analysis for individual carriers detects performance degradation before it impacts service quality

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier performance and compliance data)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load data by carrier)
- Service 09 - Claims (claims data by carrier)
