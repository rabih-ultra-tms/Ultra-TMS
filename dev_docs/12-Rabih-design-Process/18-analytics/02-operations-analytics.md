## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Report

## Description
Operational metrics report showing load volume trends, on-time pickup/delivery rates, average transit times, load-to-truck ratios, dispatch efficiency, and exception rates. Supports date range selection and drill-down by lane, equipment type, and dispatcher.

## Key Design Considerations
- Operational bottleneck identification through exception rate analysis drives process improvement
- Dispatcher-level metrics enable performance management and workload balancing

## Dependencies
- Service 04 - TMS Core (all operational load data)
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier performance data)
