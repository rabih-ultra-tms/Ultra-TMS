## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Report builder tool for creating custom reports from available data sources. Supports drag-and-drop field selection, filter configuration, grouping/aggregation, chart type selection, and report saving/sharing.

## Key Design Considerations
- Drag-and-drop interface must be intuitive for non-technical users while supporting complex queries
- Report preview with live data ensures the report produces expected results before saving

## Dependencies
- All data sources across the TMS platform
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (report access permissions)
