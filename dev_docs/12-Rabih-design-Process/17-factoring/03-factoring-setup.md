## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Factoring company configuration form for setting up new factoring relationships. Includes company info, contact details, payment instructions (ACH/wire details), notice of assignment upload, and carrier association.

## Key Design Considerations
- Notice of Assignment (NOA) document management is legally required for factoring relationships
- Payment instruction accuracy is critical -- incorrect routing causes payment failures and carrier dissatisfaction

## Dependencies
- Service 10 - Documents (NOA document storage)
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier association to factoring company)
