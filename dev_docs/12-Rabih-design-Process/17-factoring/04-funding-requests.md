## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Pending funding requests list showing requests from factoring companies for payment on carrier invoices. Displays request date, factoring company, carrier, load reference, amount, and approval status.

## Key Design Considerations
- Verification against actual load data prevents fraudulent funding requests
- Batch approval capability for high-volume factoring operations saves processing time

## Dependencies
- Service 06 - Accounting (carrier payable verification)
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load verification)
- Factoring companies within this service
