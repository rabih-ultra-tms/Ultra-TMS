## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Factor relationships list showing all factoring companies the brokerage works with, including company name, contact info, number of carriers using them, total factored volume, and payment method/terms.

## Key Design Considerations
- Carrier count per factoring company helps understand payment routing complexity
- Payment method details (ACH, wire) per factoring company ensure correct payment processing

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (carrier-to-factoring-company associations)
