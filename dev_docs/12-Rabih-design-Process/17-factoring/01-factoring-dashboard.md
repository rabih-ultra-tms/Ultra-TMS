This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Factoring overview dashboard showing active factoring relationships, pending funding requests, upcoming scheduled payments, total factored amount, and factoring fee costs.

## Key Design Considerations
- Factoring fee cost tracking helps assess the true cost of quick-pay carrier relationships
- Pending funding request alerts prevent delays in carrier payment processing

## Dependencies
- Service 05 - Carrier (carriers using factoring)
- Service 06 - Accounting (payment data routed through factoring)
