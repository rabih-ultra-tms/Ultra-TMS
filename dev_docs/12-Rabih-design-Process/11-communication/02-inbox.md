## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Received messages inbox showing all incoming emails and messages with sender, subject, preview, date, read status, and associated entity (load, carrier, customer). Supports search, filtering, and bulk actions.

## Key Design Considerations
- Conversation threading groups related messages for context continuity
- Association with TMS entities (loads, carriers) enables quick context switching to related records

## Dependencies
- Email service provider integration for incoming email
- Service 04 - TMS Core (load references in messages)
