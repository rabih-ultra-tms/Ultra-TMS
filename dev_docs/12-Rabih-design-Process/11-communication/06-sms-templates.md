## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
SMS template library listing all SMS templates with template name, category, message text, character count, language (English/Spanish), and usage statistics.

## Key Design Considerations
- Bilingual templates (English/Spanish) with side-by-side editing ensures consistency across languages
- Character count display with segment indicator prevents unexpected multi-segment messages

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (admin permissions)
