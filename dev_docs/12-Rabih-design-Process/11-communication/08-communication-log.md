## Description
Comprehensive communication audit log showing all outbound and inbound communications (emails, SMS, notifications) across the system with sender, recipient, channel, timestamp, status, and associated entity.

## Key Design Considerations

- Filtering by associated entity (load, carrier, customer) enables quick communication history retrieval

## Dependencies

- Service 22 - Audit (audit logging infrastructure)
