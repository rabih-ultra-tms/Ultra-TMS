## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Unified communication dashboard showing all message channels (email, SMS, in-app notifications) in one view. Displays unread counts, recent messages, and quick access to compose new messages.

## Key Design Considerations
- Unified inbox across multiple channels (email, SMS, notifications) requires clear visual differentiation
- Real-time message delivery and read status updates are essential for dispatch communication

## Dependencies
- Service 01 - Auth & Admin (user preferences for notification settings)
- Email service provider (SendGrid, SES)
- SMS service provider (Twilio or equivalent)
