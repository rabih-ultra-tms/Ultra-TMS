## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave. Key design requirements to be determined.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
User feedback submission form with category selection, rating scale, free-text description, screenshot attachment, and optional contact preference for follow-up.

## Key Design Considerations
- Lightweight form that minimizes friction to encourage feedback submission
- Contextual pre-population (current page, user role) to provide useful metadata automatically

## Dependencies
- Feedback categorization options
- Document service for screenshot/attachment uploads
- User authentication for submitter identification
