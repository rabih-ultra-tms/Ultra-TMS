## Description
Capacity planning interface showing resource availability forecasts, booking density heatmaps, bottleneck identification, and capacity adjustment recommendations across scheduling horizons.

## Key Design Considerations
- Heatmap visualization of booking density across time slots to identify over- and under-utilized periods
- What-if scenario modeling for evaluating the impact of adding or removing resources on capacity

## Dependencies
- Resource Calendar (Service 36, Screen 2) for current booking data
- Historical scheduling data for demand forecasting
- TMS Core for upcoming load volume projections
