## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Calendar

## Description
Visual calendar interface for viewing and managing resource schedules across drivers, equipment, docks, and facilities with day, week, and month views and drag-and-drop scheduling.

## Key Design Considerations
- Multi-resource calendar with side-by-side or stacked views for comparing schedules across resources
- Drag-and-drop appointment creation and rescheduling with automatic conflict detection

## Dependencies
- Carrier service for driver and equipment availability data
- TMS Core for load schedule data
- Appointment Manager (Service 36, Screen 3) for appointment details
