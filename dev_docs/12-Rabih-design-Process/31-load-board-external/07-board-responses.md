## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of carrier responses received from external load board postings, showing carrier details, proposed rates, equipment info, availability, and response status for review and acceptance.

## Key Design Considerations
- Quick carrier vetting workflow integrating safety scores and past performance data inline with responses
- One-click acceptance flow that transitions a board response into a carrier assignment in TMS Core

## Dependencies
- Posted Loads (Service 31, Screen 4)
- Carrier service for carrier vetting data
- TMS Core for load assignment workflow
- Safety service for carrier safety scores
