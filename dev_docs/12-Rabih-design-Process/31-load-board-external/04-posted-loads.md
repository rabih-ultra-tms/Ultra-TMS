## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
List of all loads currently posted or previously posted to external load boards, showing posting status, which boards, response counts, time posted, and expiration details.

## Key Design Considerations
- Multi-board posting management allowing a single load to be posted to multiple boards simultaneously
- Quick actions for refreshing, extending, or removing postings across boards

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for load data
- Board Connections (Service 31, Screen 2)
- Board Responses (Service 31, Screen 7) for response counts
