## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Configuration form for connecting to a new external load board, including API credentials, posting preferences, auto-posting rules, and notification settings.

## Key Design Considerations
- Step-by-step setup with connection testing before saving the configuration
- Auto-posting rule builder defining which loads should be automatically posted based on criteria like lane, age, or equipment type

## Dependencies
- Board Connections (Service 31, Screen 2)
- Integration Hub for API credential storage
- TMS Core for load criteria field definitions
