Search

## Description
Search interface for querying external load boards to find available carrier capacity, including filters for origin, destination, equipment type, availability dates, and rate preferences.

## Key Design Considerations
- Unified search across multiple boards with results aggregated and deduplicated
- Map-based visualization of available carriers in relation to load pickup locations

## Dependencies
- Board Connections (Service 31, Screen 2)
- Carrier service for matching search results to known carriers
- Rate Intelligence for market rate context
