List

## Description
List of all configured external load board connections showing connection status, subscription level, API health, posting limits, and usage statistics for each board.

## Key Design Considerations
- Connection health indicators with automatic reconnection status and error details
- Subscription and usage tracking to monitor API call limits and posting quotas

## Dependencies
- Integration Hub for API connection management
- Board Setup (Service 31, Screen 3) for configuring new connections
- External load board API credentials
