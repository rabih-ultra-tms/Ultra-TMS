## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Detail

## Description
Mobile-optimized load detail view showing complete load information including stops, contacts, special instructions, documents, and action buttons for check calls, document capture, and status updates.

## Key Design Considerations
- Collapsible sections for stop details, contacts, and instructions to manage screen real estate
- One-tap calling for shipper/receiver contacts and one-tap navigation to stop addresses

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for load detail data
- Load List (Service 32, Screen 2) for navigation
- Check Call Entry (Service 32, Screen 4)
- Document Capture (Service 32, Screen 5)
