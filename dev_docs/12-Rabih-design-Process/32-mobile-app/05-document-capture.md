## Description
Camera-based document capture tool for photographing BOLs, PODs, lumper receipts, and other shipping documents, with automatic image enhancement, document type tagging, and upload to the document management system.

## Key Design Considerations
- Auto-crop and image enhancement to ensure captured documents are legible and properly framed
- Offline queue for captured documents that automatically uploads when connectivity is restored

## Dependencies
- Device camera hardware access
- Document service for storage and categorization
- TMS Core for associating documents with loads
