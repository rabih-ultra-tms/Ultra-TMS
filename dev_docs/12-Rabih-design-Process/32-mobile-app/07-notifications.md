## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Notification center displaying push notifications, load assignment alerts, schedule changes, messages from dispatch, and system announcements in a chronological feed.

## Key Design Considerations
- Priority-based notification grouping with critical alerts (new assignments, schedule changes) prominently displayed
- Actionable notifications allowing drivers to accept loads or respond to dispatch directly from the notification

## Dependencies
- Communication service for push notification delivery
- TMS Core for load-related alerts
- Mobile Settings (Service 32, Screen 8) for notification preferences
