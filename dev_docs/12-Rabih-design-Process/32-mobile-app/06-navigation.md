## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Tool

## Description
Turn-by-turn navigation integration for routing drivers to pickup and delivery locations, with truck-specific routing that considers vehicle dimensions, weight restrictions, and hazmat regulations.

## Key Design Considerations
- Truck-specific routing avoiding low bridges, weight-restricted roads, and residential areas
- Integration with native maps or third-party truck GPS apps with pre-populated destination addresses

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for stop address data
- GPS location services
- Mapping/navigation service or third-party SDK
- Load Detail (Service 32, Screen 3) for destination selection
