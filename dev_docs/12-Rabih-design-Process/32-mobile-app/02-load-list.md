## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
List

## Description
Mobile-optimized list of assigned loads showing load number, origin/destination, pickup/delivery dates, status, and key details in a scrollable card format.

## Key Design Considerations
- Card-based layout optimized for one-handed mobile use with swipe gestures for quick actions
- Offline caching of load list data so drivers can view assignments without connectivity

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for load assignment data
- Mobile Dashboard (Service 32, Screen 1) for navigation
- Load Detail (Service 32, Screen 3) for drill-down
