## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Dashboard

## Description
Mobile-optimized home screen showing current load assignment, next stop details, upcoming schedule, recent notifications, and quick-action buttons for common tasks like check calls and document capture.

## Key Design Considerations
- Thumb-friendly interface with large tap targets and minimal scrolling for critical information
- Context-aware dashboard that prioritizes information based on driver's current load status (en route, at stop, available)

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for active load assignments
- Communication service for notifications
- GPS location services
