## Design Status

This screen will be designed as part of a future wave.

## Screen Type
Form

## Description
Mobile form for submitting check calls with auto-populated GPS location, status selection (arrived, loaded, departed, delivered), timestamp, and optional notes field.

## Key Design Considerations
- Auto-fill GPS coordinates and nearest city/state to minimize manual data entry
- Quick-submit status buttons (Arrived, Loaded, Departed, Delivered) for single-tap check call creation

## Dependencies
- TMS Core for load and stop data
- GPS location services for automatic location capture
- Communication service for dispatching check call updates
